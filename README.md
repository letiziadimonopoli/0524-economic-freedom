# Exploring the impact of Government Size and Legal Systems on Economic Freedom (May 2024)

ðŸ“– Overview

This project explores the impact of Government Size and Legal Systems on Economic Freedom.

ðŸŽ¯ Research Goal

Economic freedom can be measured by an index, which is used worldwide. It refers to the degree to which individuals in society have the freedom to take part in economic activities, which range from entering a contract to owning a property. How does the size of the government relate to the overall level of economic freedom in different countries? How do the legal systems & property rights affect the economic freedom score of a country? Are there countries with specific legal systems where the significance of the impact is particularly higher or lower?
